\chapter{Inferring the connectivity of a mouse's neuronal system}

In chapter 4 a neural network model was simulated to try and mimic the behaviour of the real network described in \ref{sec:mouse_resultsset}. A new input stimulus and two cascade generation methods were proposed. In this chapter, the suitability of these new methods will be proved by inferring the connectivity of the new simulation modality outlined in section \ref{sec:input_stimulus}. Moreover, the effect of the simulation duration and the network size on the performance of the algorithm will be assessed.\\

Once the suitability has been demonstrated, the same algorithm will be used to infer the connectivity of one of the networks from the CRCNS dataset. Further analysis of this structure will be carried out and its main characteristics will be described.\\

In order to evaluate the performance of the algorithm, the four metrics described in \ref{sec:performance_metrics} will be used. However, as outlined in \cite{pranav_report}, the structure of the network can have a great effect on NetRate's ability to estimate it. For this reason, for validating the suitability of the model, an average of 4 experiments will be used as the results displayed in this chapter.
