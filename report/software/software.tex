\section{Programming languages}

The software that is used for this project is based on a set of scripts written in bash, Python and MATLAB. Each of these languages is used in a different where they excel due to either availability of libraries or ease of use. \\

Bash scripts are used as the entry point to the software package, their main function is iterating through tests, calling the functions that simulate and infer networks, and move the output files in an organized manner.
MATLAB is the language in which the optimization problem is defined. The need for a convex optimization tool that implements recursive quadratic programming made it imperative to use this programming language. CVX is a software package that meets this criteria. Although there is also a version of this package available for Python, it does make use of recursive quadratic programming and the accuracy of NetRate is
